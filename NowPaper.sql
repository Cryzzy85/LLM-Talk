We examine a toy model of associative memory and the ultimate limitations it is subjected to within the framework of general probabilistic theories (GPTs), which represent the most general class of physical theories satisfying some basic operational axioms. We ask ourselves how large the dimension of a GPT should be so that it can accommodate $2^m$ states with the property that any $N$ of them are perfectly distinguishable. Call $d(N,m)$ the minimal such dimension. Invoking an old result by Danzer and Gr\\\"unbaum, we prove that $d(2,m)=m+1$, to be compared with $O(2^m)$ when the GPT is required to be either classical or quantum. This yields an example of a task where GPTs outperform both classical and quantum theory exponentially. More generally, we resolve the case of fixed $N$ and asymptotically large $m$, proving that $d(N,m) \\leq m^{1+o_N(1)}$ (as $m\\to\\infty$) for every $N\\geq 2$, which yields again an exponential improvement over classical and quantum theories. Finally, we develop a numerical approach to the general problem of finding the largest $N$-wise mutually distinguishable set for a given GPT, which can be seen as an instance of the maximum clique problem on $N$-regular hypergraphs.', 'NLP', 'AI Development', 'I.

The false claims, as difficult as they are to expose, create a lot of damage. To tackle the problem, fact verification becomes crucial and thus has been a topic of interest among diverse research communities. Using only the textual form of data we propose our solution to the problem and achieve competitive results with other approaches. We present our solution based on two approaches - PLM (pre-trained language model) based method and Prompt based method. The PLM-based approach uses the traditional supervised learning, where the model is trained to take \'x\' as input and output prediction \'y\' as P(y|x). Whereas, Prompt-based learning reflects the idea to design input to fit the model such that the original objective may be re-framed as a problem of (masked) language modeling. We may further stimulate the rich knowledge provided by PLMs to better serve downstream tasks by employing extra prompts to fine-tune PLMs. Our experiments showed that the proposed method performs better than just fine-tuning PLMs. We achieved an F1 score of 0.6946 on the FACTIFY dataset and a 7th position on the competition leader-board.', 'Model Evolution', 'AI Development', '1. Introduction\n\n    Problem Statement: The spread of false news necessitates fact verification. The researchers focus on fact-checking using the Factify dataset.\n    Methodologies: They employ the traditional Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) based method and a Prompt-Based Learning approach.\n    Proposed Approach: These two methods are combined for the 5-class classification task. This blend improves efficient segregation of one class, leading to better results.\n    Disclaimer: The authors focus only on textual information from the Factify dataset, despite its inclusion of visual data.\n\n2. Preliminary Information\n\n    Keywords: Deep Learning, Factify, Prompt-based learning, PLM, NLP, RoBERTa, DeBERTa, Stacking, Ensembling\n    Related Work: Pretrained Language Models (PLMs): PLMs like RoBERTa, GPT, T5, and BERT excel in text generation and language understanding. However, discrepancies in \'pre-training\' and \'fine-tuning\' objectives limit their use. \'Prompt tuning\' has been proposed to bridge this gap.\n\n3. Dataset\n\n    Factify: A multi-modal fact verification dataset with text and images for claims, references, etc. It comprises 35,000 instances for training and 7,500 for validation.\n\n4. Approach and Methods\n\n    Method: Using Pretrained Language Models: Models used are RoBERTa, DeBERTa, XLM-RoBERTa, and ALBERT. Data is preprocessed by concatenating claim text with OCR text, with a max length of 256. Stratified 5-fold cross-validation is used for training.\n    Method: PLM Based Approach: Models are fine-tuned on the dataset, and their predictions are ensembled for improved scores.\n    Method: Prompt Based Approach: Each instance is mapped to a prompt using a template, and the predicted token is mapped to its class. The \'refute\' class is efficiently filtered out, converting the multi-class task into binary classification. The remaining task is handled by the PLM based approach.\n\n5. Model Details\n\n    RoBERTa: Improves upon BERT by modifying its architecture and training procedure.\n    DeBERTa: Introduces two novel techniques: disentangled self-attention and Enhanced Mask Decoder.\n    XLM-RoBERTa: A multilingual version of RoBERTa, trained on 100 languages.\n    ALBERT: Reduces model size without losing performance.\n\n6. Results\n\n    Individual Model Scores: DeBERTa: 0.7305, RoBERTa: 0.7082, XLM-RoBERTa: 0.6985, ALBERT: 0.6871.\n    Stacking Ensemble: An ensemble of the model predictions leads to a score of 0.7360.\n    Proposed Method: The combined PLM and prompt-based method result in an F1 score of 0.6946, leading to the 7th position on the competition leaderboard.\n\n7. Conclusion\nThe blend of the PLM-based and prompt-based learning methods provides a significant boost in performance. Pretraining using MLM and ensembling also contribute to improved results.'),

We utilize two multiple-choice medical exam questions (USMLE and MedMCQA) and a medical reading comprehension dataset (PubMedQA).

To date, visible LLM-based code completion frameworks such as GitHub Copilot and GPT are trained using deep learning over vast quantities of unstructured text and open source code. As the paramount component and the cornerstone in daily programming tasks, code completion has largely boosted professionals\' efficiency in building real-world software systems. In contrast to this flourishing market, we find that code completion systems often output suspicious results, and to date, an automated testing and enhancement framework for code completion systems is not available. This research proposes CCTEST, a framework to test and repair code completion systems in blackbox settings. CCTEST features a set of novel mutation strategies, namely program structure-correlated (PSC) mutations, to generate mutated code completion inputs. Then, it detects inconsistent outputs, representing possibly erroneous cases, from all the completed code cases. Moreover, CCTEST repairs the code completion outputs by selecting the output that mostly reflects the \"average\" appearance of all output cases, as the final output of the code completion systems. We detected a total of 33,540 inputs (with a true positive rate of 86%) that can trigger erroneous cases from eight popular LLM-based code completion systems.

The framework uses program structure-consistent (PSC) mutations to create varied inputs for testing. When inconsistencies or errors occur, CCTEST selects the output closest to the average to repair the code. Through this process, CCTEST notably improved the accuracy of eight popular code completion systems, paving the way for future research in this area.\nI. Introduction and Background\n\nA. Problem: Code completion systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate erroneous results due to their complexity.

Prior Work: This research is a novel exploration into automated testing and enhancement of code completion systems.\nII. Workflow of CCTEST\n\nA. Prompt Variants Generation: The process begins by mutating the initial prompt into structurally consistent variants using a technique called Program Structure-Consistent (PSC) mutations.\n\nB. Testing Oracle Generation: The output from the code completion system is compared for consistency, with outliers considered erroneous.\n\nC. Completion Output Enhancement: CCTEST selects an output that most closely aligns with the average output, thereby enhancing the code completion results.\nIII. Implementation of CCTEST\n\nA. Study Scope: The focus is on detecting and correcting erroneous code completion outputs and recording any defects that prevent output generation.\n\nB. Implementation: CCTEST currently supports syntactically correct Python code snippets due to its popularity and representativeness.\n\nC.

Human Evaluation: A panel of twelve experts evaluated samples and found that CCTEST significantly enhanced the outputs.\nVI. Discussion and Future Work\n\nA. Limitations: The current scope of CCTEST is limited to Python, and there may be undetected defects if outputs share erroneous patterns.\n\nB. Potential Enhancements: Future versions may include cross-comparisons of code completion outputs, adaptations for other languages, and more natural-looking mutations.\n\nC.

Perplexity was originally conceived as an information-theoretic measure to assess how much a given language model is suited to predict a text sequence or, equivalently, how much a word sequence fits into a specific language model. We carried out an extensive experimentation with the publicly available data, and employed language models as diverse as N-grams, from 2-grams to 5-grams, and GPT-2, a transformer-based language model. We investigated whether perplexity scores may be used to discriminate between the transcripts of healthy subjects and subjects suffering from Alzheimer Disease (AD). Our best performing models achieved full accuracy and F-score (1.00 in both precision/specificity and recall/sensitivity) in categorizing subjects from both the AD class and control subjects.

Overview:\n\n    This paper explores the use of language models to differentiate between mentally impaired and healthy individuals using the perplexity metric.\n    It is based on the article \"Semantic coherence markers: The contribution of perplexity metrics.\"\n    The primary focus is on early detection and intervention for those at high risk of developing mental disorders.\n    It leverages advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for accurate diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses.\n\nII. Background Information\n\nA. Related Work:\n\n    NLP techniques are applied for differentiating patients with psychiatric disorders from healthy individuals and predicting the onset of psychiatric disturbances.\n    Perplexity is used as a comparative metric for text sequences from healthy individuals and those with language-related disturbances.\n    Perplexity has been linked to complexity in spoken language in aging and onset of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).\n\nB. Perplexity as a Tool:\n\n    Perplexity serves as a predictor for Alzheimer Disease (AD) by analyzing DementiaBank’s Pitt Corpus transcriptions.\n    Different language models (LMs) are employed, with one trained on healthy individuals and the other on AD patients.\n    The difference in perplexity scores between the two groups is used to characterize each speaker.\n\nIII. Methodology\n\nA. Objective:\n\n    The research focuses on the reliability of perplexity in assessing the language of healthy individuals.\n    It examines variations in perplexity scores within the same individual to predict AD diagnosis.\n\nB. Approach:\n\n    The study leverages two types of LMs, N-grams, and GPT-2 models, and four different decision rules based on average perplexity scores.\n    Only data from subjects with at least two transcripts are analyzed, differentiating this research from previous work.\n\nIV. Experiments\n\nA. Description:\n\n    The experiments aim to distinguish the language of subjects with disorders from that of healthy controls using perplexity metrics.\n    Two different LMs (N-grams and GPT-2) are used, and their perplexity scores are compared.\n    The models are trained on the Pitt Corpus, featuring transcripts from dementia patients and healthy controls.\n\nB. Data Collection:\n\n    The dataset includes 552 files divided into Control (243 items) and Dementia (309 items) categories.\n    Pre-processing was undertaken to simplify the text, ignoring pauses and hesitation phenomena.\n    Only data from participants who attended more than once are included in the study.\n\nV. Language Models\n\nA. N-grams:\n\n    A simple language model is implemented, where each word is conditioned on the preceding N-1 tokens.\n    The probability of Bigrams is estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation.\n    The Kneser-Ney Smoothing technique addresses unseen N-grams.\n\nB. GPT-2:\n\n    A pre-trained GPT-2 model from the Hugging Face Transformers library is used.\n    The text is preprocessed by the pre-trained tokenizer and grouped into blocks of 1024 tokens.\n    Perplexity of a text is computed according to a specific equation.\n\nVI. Results and Implications\n\n    Perplexity scores effectively distinguished between healthy individuals and AD patients.\n    The models achieved perfect precision/specificity, recall/sensitivity, and F-score (1.00) in categorizing subjects.\n    The findings highlight the potential of perplexity as an analytic tool for early diagnosis of mental disorders.\n\nVII. Future Work\n\n    Different language models may attain similar accuracy with fewer training/fine-tuning efforts.\n    Refinements to the language models and categorization strategy may lead to significant improvements.\n    Further experiments will assess perplexity on larger samples and different types of spoken language, and also experiment with different languages and their associated language models.\n\nVIII. Conclusion\n\n    The proof-of-concept study found that perplexity scores alone provided valuable results in predicting whether a transcript author was afflicted by dementia or was a healthy subject.\n    The study achieved a significant reduction in the amount of information compared to the clinical evidence collected by human experts.\n    This promising finding indicates the potential for future applications of language models and perplexity in the field of mental health diagnosis.'),

Instructors need to be able to detect such text generated by large language models, either with the naked eye or with the help of some tools. There is also growing need to understand the lexical, syntactic and stylistic features of AIGC. To address these challenges in English language teaching, we first present ArguGPT, a balanced corpus of 4,038 argumentative essays generated by 7 GPT models in response to essay prompts from three sources: (1) in-class or homework exercises, (2) TOEFL and (3) GRE writing tasks. Machine-generated texts are paired with roughly equal number of human-written essays with three score levels matched in essay prompts. We then hire English instructors to distinguish machine essays from human ones. Results show that when first exposed to machine-generated essays, the instructors only have an accuracy of 61% in detecting them. But the number rises to 67% after one round of minimal self-training. Next, we perform linguistic analyses of these essays, which show that machines produce sentences with more complex syntactic structures while human essays tend to be lexically more complex. Finally, we test existing AIGC detectors and build our own detectors using SVMs and RoBERTa. Results suggest that a RoBERTa fine-tuned with the training set of ArguGPT achieves above 90% accuracy in both essay- and sentence-level classification.

This is due to the gap between the two tasks the NER and LLMs: the former is a sequence labeling task in nature while the latter is a text-generation model. In this paper, we propose GPT-NER to resolve this issue. GPT-NER bridges the gap by transforming the sequence labeling task to a generation task that can be easily adapted by LLMs e.g., the task of finding location entities in the input text \"Columbus is a city\" is transformed to generate the text sequence \"@@Columbus## is a city\", where special tokens @@## marks the entity to extract. To efficiently address the \"hallucination\" issue of LLMs, where LLMs have a strong inclination to over-confidently label NULL inputs as entities, we propose a self-verification strategy by prompting LLMs to ask itself whether the extracted entities belong to a labeled entity tag. We conduct experiments on five widely adopted NER datasets, and GPT-NER achieves comparable performances to fully supervised baselines, which is the first time as far as we are concerned.

However, in addition to confidently presenting factually inaccurate information at times (known as \"hallucinations\"), LLMs are also inherently limited by the number of input and output tokens that can be processed at once, making them potentially less effective on tasks that require processing a large set or continuous stream of information. A common approach to reducing the size of data is through lossless or lossy compression. Yet, in some cases it may not be strictly necessary to perfectly recover every detail from the original data, as long as a requisite level of semantic precision or intent is conveyed. This paper presents three contributions to research on LLMs. First, we present the results from experiments exploring the viability of approximate compression using LLMs, focusing specifically on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 via ChatGPT interfaces. Second, we investigate and quantify the capability of LLMs to compress text and code, as well as to recall and manipulate compressed representations of prompts. Third, we present two novel metrics -- Exact Reconstructive Effectiveness (ERE) and Semantic Reconstruction Effectiveness (SRE) -- that quantify the level of preserved intent between text compressed and decompressed by the LLMs we studied.

Abstract:\nThe paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for data compression and its implications in information retrieval, question answering, and code generation tasks. LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are examined to determine their ability to perform \"approximate compression\" and preserve semantic essence. The study introduces two novel metrics, Semantic Reconstruction Effectiveness (SRE) and Exact Reconstruction Effectiveness (ERE), to quantify the quality of LLM compression.\n\nII. Introduction:\nIntroduces the significance of LLMs in information retrieval and prompt engineering. Emphasizes the challenge of LLMs having a maximum input size, which limits the amount of information that can be provided in a prompt. The paper proposes exploring LLMs\' ability to compress prompts and presents research questions on whether LLMs can efficiently compress and decompress data while preserving semantics.\n\nIII. Background on Compression vs. Embeddings:\nDifferentiates between embeddings and compression as applied in LLMs. Embeddings provide a one-way mapping for representing high-dimensional vectors into a lower-dimensional space, while compression aims to efficiently store and process information while preserving semantics.\n\nIV. Experiments on LLM Compression:\nPresents experiments using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to explore LLM-based compression. Fictional and factual text from the internet, as well as code summarization and generation tasks, are evaluated. The paper also discusses prompt engineering approaches for facilitating compression and iterative construction of data.\n\nvbnet\n\nA. Analyzing LLM Compression Performance on Literary Text:\nProvides initial results from experiments evaluating LLM compression capabilities. Focuses on GPT-4 and Zlib\'s Deflate compression algorithm. Presents the evaluation set of fictional literary text and explains the use of entropy and compression ratio metrics.\n\nB. Analysis: Entropy:\nExplains the calculation of entropy to measure randomness in the distribution of compressed characters. Shows the entropy of GPT-4 compressed text compared to Zlib baselines.\n\nC. Analysis: Compression Ratio:\nDescribes the computation of the Compression Ratio (CR) to measure the reduction in text size. Illustrates the compression ratio for each method across all texts.\n\nD. Analysis: Edit Distance:\nIntroduces the concept of edit distance to quantify the difference between original and reconstructed text. Shows the edit distances for each compression method over all texts.\n\nV. Results: LLM Compression for Code Generation:\nAnalyzes results from experiments on code generation tasks and evaluates the quality of LLM compression using various metrics like compression ratio, edit distance, and semantic reconstruction effectiveness.\n\nvbnet\n\nA. Evaluating GPT-4 Semantic Compression:\nTo evaluate GPT-4\'s ability in using semantic compression for code generation, four instances of GPT-4 were used. The first instance was given Python functions and prompted to generate detailed descriptions of their expected behavior. The second instance was then prompted to semantically compress the function descriptions generated by the first instance. The third and fourth instances were given prompts to reconstruct the Python functions using the unaltered and compressed text descriptions, respectively. The reconstructed functions were then compared to assess GPT-4\'s ability to leverage semantic compression for code generation tasks.\n\nB. Code Generation from Base Descriptions:\nA performance baseline was established to understand the effectiveness of semantic compression in code generation. The first two test functions were confused by GPT-4, operating at the character level instead of the string level for input lists. However, overall, GPT-4 accurately reconstructed the original functions using unaltered text descriptions.\n\nC. Code Generation from Compressed Text:\nGPT-4 was able to accurately reconstruct the original Python functions from semantically compressed text descriptions of Python source code. Despite information loss due to compression, the model retained essential semantics required for code generation.\n\nD. Result Implications:\nThe experiments showed that GPT-4 can reliably reconstruct code from compressed text descriptions, indicating its ability to retain essential semantic information despite compression. This suggests that GPT-4 can reconstruct code with functional accuracy even with significantly reduced prompts.\n\nE. Compressive Meta-Prompting for Code Generation:\nA meta-prompting approach was explored to enable code generation directives and language change directives for LLMs. Preliminary experiments showed promise in using compressive meta-prompts to specify complex coding tasks in a concise manner.\n\nVI. Additional Studies and Qualitative Findings:\nExplores additional research avenues and summarizes qualitative findings from the experiments. Provides open-source code for the experiments.\n\nVII. Comparison with Related Work on LLMs and Data Compression:\nCompares the proposed approach with related work in evaluating LLMs and data compression techniques.\n\nVIII.

(2023, 'Lee, Min Young', 'Building Multimodal AI Chatbots', 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03512', 'This work aims to create a multimodal AI system that chats with humans and shares relevant photos. While earlier works were limited to dialogues about specific objects or scenes within images, recent works have incorporated images into open-domain dialogues. However, their response generators are unimodal, accepting text input but no image input, thus prone to generating responses contradictory to the images shared in the dialogue. Therefore, this work proposes a complete chatbot system using two multimodal deep learning models: an image retriever that understands texts and a response generator that understands images. The image retriever, implemented by ViT and BERT, selects the most relevant image given the dialogue history and a database of images. The response generator, implemented by ViT and GPT-2/DialoGPT, generates an appropriate response given the dialogue history and the most recently retrieved image. The two models are trained and evaluated on PhotoChat, an open-domain dialogue dataset in which a photo is shared in each session. In automatic evaluation, the proposed image retriever outperforms existing baselines VSE++ and SCAN with Recall@1/5/10 of 0.1/0.3/0.4 and MRR of 0.2 when ranking 1,000 images. The proposed response generator also surpasses the baseline Divter with PPL of 16.9, BLEU-1/2 of 0.13/0.03, and Distinct-1/2 of 0.97/0.86, showing a significant improvement in PPL by -42.8 and BLEU-1/2 by +0.07/0.02.

MultiModal-GPT can follow various instructions from humans, such as generating a detailed caption, counting the number of interested objects, and answering general questions from users. MultiModal-GPT is parameter-efficiently fine-tuned from OpenFlamingo, with Low-rank Adapter (LoRA) added both in the cross-attention part and the self-attention part of the language model. We first construct instruction templates with vision and language data for multi-modality instruction tuning to make the model understand and follow human instructions. We find the quality of training data is vital for the dialogue performance, where few data containing short answers can lead the model to respond shortly to any instructions. To further enhance the ability to chat with humans of the MultiModal-GPT, we utilize language-only instruction-following data to train the MultiModal-GPT jointly.

This is due to (1) the lack of reasoning ability in addressing complex linguistic phenomena (e.g., intensification, contrast, irony etc); (2) limited number of tokens allowed in in-context learning. In this paper, we introduce Clue And Reasoning Prompting (CARP). CARP adopts a progressive reasoning strategy tailored to addressing the complex linguistic phenomena involved in text classification: CARP first prompts LLMs to find superficial clues (e.g., keywords, tones, semantic relations, references, etc), based on which a diagnostic reasoning process is induced for final decisions. To further address the limited-token issue, CARP uses a fine-tuned model on the supervised dataset for $k$NN demonstration search in the in-context learning, allowing the model to take the advantage of both LLM\'s generalization ability and the task-specific evidence provided by the full labeled dataset. Remarkably, CARP yields new SOTA performances on 4 out of 5 widely-used text-classification benchmarks, 97.39 (+1.24) on SST-2, 96.40 (+0.72) on AGNews, 98.78 (+0.25) on R8 and 96.95 (+0.6) on R52, and a performance comparable to SOTA on MR (92.39 v.s. 93.3).

The research focuses on Walt Whitman\'s style. Despite their human-like performance on various tasks, these models struggle to produce poetry in the desired style using zero-shot prompts, even when provided with extensive examples. Fine-tuning remains the recommended approach for generating poetry in a specific author\'s style.\n\nIntroduction:\nGPT-3.5, GPT-3.5-turbo, and GPT-4 are examined for their capability to generate poetry using zero-shot prompts. Prior research suggests that GPT models possess inherent skills, and prompts invoke those abilities. The target author for this study is Walt Whitman, known for his unique poetic style.\n\nMethod:\nThe experiment involves generating poems of increasing complexity using consecutive GPT models, aiming to match Whitman\'s style. However, even with explicit instructions, the poems often follow a different structure, typically a 4-line stanza with rhyming. A comparison with fine-tuned GPT-3 models demonstrates a clear contrast in style.\n\nExperiments:\nThe study tests GPT\'s ability to retrieve Whitman\'s original poems. GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 show reasonable accuracy in retrieving poems, while GPT-3.5 fails to do so correctly. The ability of GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 to retrieve Whitman\'s poems confirms their familiarity with his style.\n\nMain Finding:\nGenerating poetry in a specific author\'s style using GPT-3.5, GPT-3.5-turbo, and GPT-4 without fine-tuning does not produce satisfactory results. Fine-tuning the models remains the recommended approach for achieving the desired style and quality in poetry generation.\n\nExperimental Setup:\nFor the poetry generation experiments, zero-shot prompts are employed. The study includes examples of poems generated by GPT-3.5, GPT-3.5-turbo, and GPT-4, as well as a fine-tuned GPT-3 model for comparison. The data preparation involves creating four datasets, with Whitman\'s poems and summaries taken from a previous dataset. The zero-shot prompts instruct the models to write in Whitman\'s style based on given summaries. Many-shot prompts consist of 17 poems by Whitman and their summaries.\n\nData Preparation:\nFour datasets are generated for the experiments, incorporating Whitman\'s poems as well as summaries. The zero-shot prompts utilize instructions to match Whitman\'s style with provided summaries. The many-shot prompts include 17 poems by Whitman and their summaries.\n\nEvaluation:\nThe quality of the generated poems is assessed using binary classifiers that compare them to Whitman\'s original works. Fine-tuned GPT-3 models\' performance serves as a benchmark for comparison. The results indicate that poems generated through zero-shot prompts do not match Whitman\'s style and quality, while fine-tuned GPT-3 models achieve a closer resemblance.\n\nConclusion:\nGPT-3.5, GPT-3.5-turbo, and GPT-4 show limitations in generating poetry in a specific author\'s style without fine-tuning. The fine-tuned GPT-3 models, on the other hand, effectively reproduce complex author-specific styles like that of Whitman. Although the possibility of using many-shot prompts with GPT-4 is explored, further investigation is required to determine its effectiveness.\n\nNote: This structured information provides a comprehensive overview of the study\'s key points, enabling the large language model to process and retrieve information efficiently.

However, collecting human-written high-quality data, especially multi-turn dialogues, is expensive and unattainable for most people. Though previous studies have used powerful LLMs to generate the dialogues automatically, but they all suffer from generating untruthful dialogues because of the LLMs hallucination. Therefore, we propose a method called RefGPT to generate enormous truthful and customized dialogues without worrying about factual errors caused by the model hallucination. RefGPT solves the model hallucination in dialogue generation by restricting the LLMs to leverage the given reference instead of reciting their own knowledge to generate dialogues. Additionally, RefGPT adds detailed controls on every utterances to enable highly customization capability, which previous studies have ignored. On the basis of RefGPT, we also propose two high-quality dialogue datasets generated by GPT-4, namely RefGPT-Fact and RefGPT-Code. RefGPT-Fact is 100k multi-turn dialogue datasets based on factual knowledge and RefGPT-Code is 76k multi-turn dialogue dataset covering a wide range of coding scenarios.

Introduction\n\nRefGPT, a novel method for generating truthful and customized dialogues, aims to address the challenge of hallucinations (untruthful dialogues) in Large Language Models (LLMs). Instead of relying on the LLM\'s own knowledge, it directs the model to utilize a provided reference. RefGPT introduces a new degree of control over each dialogue utterance and has been used to generate two high-quality dialogue datasets, RefGPT-Fact and RefGPT-Code, using GPT-4.\n\nIII. Background\n\nLLMs have displayed remarkable capabilities in a broad range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, generating high-quality dialogues remains challenging due to the potential for hallucinations and the high cost of obtaining instruction datasets. The proposed method, RefGPT, mitigates these issues by providing a plain text or document reference and allowing for detailed customization of the dialogue\'s structure, style, and content.\n\nIV. RefGPT Generation Process\n\n    Reference Selection: To ensure truthfulness, appropriate references are selected based on quality and themes. The model has the potential to generate dialogues in any domain with suitable text knowledge base reserves.\n    Basic Prompt: It serves the basic dialogue generation requirements such as language specification, unreasonable request rejection, and precise controls over the chatbot\'s behavior and responses.\n    Dialogue Settings: This step involves converting the reference into a specific dialogue format and customizing each utterance, a process called local customization.\n\nV. RefGPT Dialogue Settings Detail\n\n    Dialogue Structure: Marked with <chat>, <user>, and <assistant> tags, with turn count management and utterance length control.\n    Dialogue Style: Adjustable to suit the target audience.\n    Dialogue Content: Customizable according to the required information, whether factual knowledge or code-related queries.\n    Dialogue Template: A combination of local customizations, number of turns, word count for user and assistant, conversational style, and content setting.\n\nVI. Contributions\n\nThe authors have introduced the RefGPT method for generating truthful and customized dialogues, constructed two multi-turn dialogue datasets using GPT-4, and demonstrated RefGPT\'s ability to generate dialogues in various domains using relevant, domain-specific documents.\n\nVII. Related Work\n\nWhile other methods have explored synthetic data generation using LLMs, they often produce uncontrolled and potentially untruthful data due to hallucination. Synthetic data generated based on references have been used to ensure the truthfulness of QA pairs.\n\nVIII.

Despite the fact that most LLMs are trained predominantly in English, multiple studies have demonstrated their comparative performance in many other languages.

These inquiries are crucial for the study of LLMs since users and researchers often come from diverse language backgrounds, potentially influencing their utilization and interpretation of LLMs\' results. In this work, we propose a systematic way of qualifying the performance disparities of LLMs under multilingual settings.

It requires user-created, hand-crafted examples.\n    Test Case: In the case of moral reasoning, five examples from the development split of the dataset were used as few-shot exemplars. The authors manually created Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Thought Experiments reasoning for each example. The distinctions between CoT and Thought Experiments can be subtle.\n\nExperimental Setup\n\n    Testbed: The Moral Scenarios subtask in the MMLU benchmark was chosen for testing. This task is a multiple-choice question that examines the moral correctness of a main character\'s actions in two different scenarios.\n    Model: The experiments were performed using Flan-PaLM 540B with a temperature of 0.7.\n    Evaluation: Task accuracy on the test split for each method was reported.\n\nTask Accuracy\n\n    Zero-shot prompting results: Direct zero-shot prompted an accuracy of 57.09% without self-consistency and 53.97% with self-consistency. Zero-shot CoT had lower performance. However, the proposed zero-shot Thought Experiments showed improvement.\n    Few-shot results: Compared to zero-shot, direct few-shot and CoT improved the accuracy. Few-shot Thought Experiments reached the highest accuracy.\n\nComparing Chain-of-Thought and Thought Experiments\n\n    Notable differences: Thought Experiments pose relevant questions and provide reasonable assumptions, leading to comprehensive reasoning and correct answers.\n\nDiscussion\n\n    Current Performance: Zero-shot out-of-the-box model performance on moral reasoning tasks is limited.\n    Challenges: Models face unique challenges in moral reasoning. Self-consistency hurts task performance in both direct and CoT zero-shot but slightly helps Thought Experiments.\n    Few-shot setup: Human-written demonstration of counterfactual reasoning helps models achieve 80+% accuracy. However, the performance gain of Thought Experiments over CoT is small.\n\nConclusion, Limitations, and Future Work\n\n    Findings: Thought Experiments improves task performance by 9% to 16% compared to direct and CoT zero-shot baselines.\n    Limitations: The experiments were conducted only on one model and one task.

However, there has been limited success so far, as researchers have found it difficult to outperform fine-tuned baseline rankers on benchmark datasets. We analyze pointwise and listwise ranking prompts used by existing methods and argue that off-the-shelf LLMs do not fully understand these ranking formulations, possibly due to the nature of how LLMs are trained. In this paper, we propose to significantly reduce the burden on LLMs by using a new technique called Pairwise Ranking Prompting (PRP). Our results are the first in the literature to achieve state-of-the-art ranking performance on standard benchmarks using moderate-sized open-sourced LLMs. On TREC-DL2020, PRP based on the Flan-UL2 model with 20B parameters outperforms the previous best approach in the literature, which is based on the blackbox commercial GPT-4 that has 50x (estimated) model size, by over 5% at NDCG@1. On TREC-DL2019, PRP is only inferior to the GPT-4 solution on the NDCG@5 and NDCG@10 metrics, while outperforming other existing solutions, such as InstructGPT which has 175B parameters, by over 10% for nearly all ranking metrics. Furthermore, we propose several variants of PRP to improve efficiency and show that it is possible to achieve competitive results even with linear complexity.

Background & Objectives:\n\n    Exploration of impact and evolution of GPT NLP models and AI on computational literature.\n    Examination of neural networks based on observation, learning, and NLP mechanisms.\n\nII. Overview of GPT Models:\n\n    Capabilities include generation of scientific and literary texts (e.g., 1 the Road by Ross Goodwin, Sunspring by Oscar Sharp and Ross Goodwin).\n    Examples of tools for implementation in creative processes: Talk to Transformer, GPT-3 Creative Fiction, Copy.ai, AI Dungeon.\n    GPT models\' limitations: cannot simulate human emotional intelligence, creativity, and narrative intelligence.\n\nIII. GPT Model Development:\n\n    GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) utilizes Transformer architecture, a neural network processing enormous amounts of texts for learning.\n    Notable developments include ChatGPT by OpenAI in 2018, its fast rise in popularity due to extensive answer capabilities and diverse applications.\n    Version growth: GPT-1 (117 million parameters, 2018), GPT-2 (1.5 billion parameters, 2019), GPT-3 (over 175 billion parameters).\n    GPT-4, announced in March 2023, features enhanced capabilities including advanced reasoning, complex instructions, more creativity.\n\nIV. GPT-3 Tasks & Limitations:\n\n    GPT-3 can perform advanced search, maintain dialogues, solve syntax/language problems, generate code, offer medical consultation, aid in developing text adventures, compose music, write fictional texts.\n    Impressive adaptive learning capacity, but prone to mistakes including meaningless statements, sloppy spelling, unnecessary code, offensive remarks.\n    Despite its vast stored data, accuracy and reliability of its answers are not guaranteed.\n\nV. AI Research & Impact:\n\n    AI systems in human creative activity being studied by various research groups.\n    AI systems can serve as a source of inspiration, a working tool, or a \"creative partner\" in creative processes.\n    AI research is a primary direction for several scientific activities and conferences.\n    Introduction:\n        The field of Artificial Intelligence, particularly GPT models, have gained considerable interest across multiple domains.\n        Various online technology magazines, scientific papers, and books offer a wealth of knowledge on the subject.\n\n    Sources of Information:\n        Academic Conferences: North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) discusses advancements in natural language models.\n        Online Articles: Platforms like Wired, The Verge, and TechCrunch regularly publish articles on GPT models.\n        Research Papers: Notably, \"Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\" by OpenAI introduces GPT-3, discussing its capabilities and limitations.\n        Books: \"Artificial Intelligence. Technologies, Applications and Challenges\" by Lavanya Sharma and Pradeep Kumar Garg, provides an overview of AI and its implications.\n        Blogs: AI researchers like Andrej Karpathy, Jay Alammar, and Lilian Weng offer insights into the development of language models.\n        Social Media: Platforms like Twitter and Reddit host communities discussing AI topics, including GPT models.\n\n    Educational Resources:\n        Courses: Stanford University’s \"Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning\" and Coursera\'s \"Deep Learning Specialization\" offer in-depth knowledge on AI models.\n        Tutorials: YouTube channels such as Two Minute Papers, Arxiv Insights, and Lex Fridman provide a wealth of educational content on GPT models.\n\n    GPT Model Applications:\n        In academic writing, GPT models can assist but cannot replace human researchers due to potential inaccuracies and deviation in understanding.\n        In creative writing, GPT models, although lacking in narrative intelligence, can aid writers in the creative process as described by Yennie Jun in her article \"Creative Writing with GPT-3: from Emoji to Flash Fiction\".\n\n    Platforms using GPT Models:\n        Platforms like Talk to Transformer, GPT-3 Creative Fiction, Copy.ai, Philosopher AI, AI Dungeon, Lumen5, and Jukebox have leveraged GPT models to provide unique functionalities.\n        GPT models have also been used in experimental novel writing, as demonstrated in Ross Goodwin\'s \"1 the Road\".\n\n    Conclusion:\n        GPT models present immense possibilities across various domains but require careful handling due to their limitations in accuracy and originality.\n\nMain Concepts:\n\n    Experiment Overview: This experiment, carried out by R. Goodwin, aimed to test AI\'s ability to write a novel. The process was documented in a film directed by Lewis Rapkin. Google and other companies funded part of the project.\n\n    AI Training and Data: The AI was trained using samples of lyric, sci-fi, and \'bleak\' writing, each comprising at least 20 million words. Data from Foursquare, a location-based social network, was also used to generate environment-specific commentary.\n\n    Writing Process: The AI used a microphone, camera, and GPS data to generate the novel\'s text. Goodwin did not edit the text, presenting the raw output to the public.\n\n    Critiques and Observations: The novel, characterized by its lack of coherence, was criticized by various individuals. Brian Merchant published a review in The Atlantic, describing parts of the novel as \"pixelated poetry\". Thomas Hornigold, in Singularity Hub, noted that the AI-written novel could not compete with human-authored works.\n\n    AI Limitations: The AI, despite being trained on 360MB of literature and being guided towards a specific style and vocabulary, struggled with maintaining coherence. R. Goodwin accepts responsibility for the AI\'s output and notes the limitations of the AI\'s understanding of the patterns it was trained on.\n\n    Related Works: A similar AI-based project was undertaken to create \'Sunspring\', a novel adapted into a short film presented at the Cannes Film Festival. This project was led by Oscar Sharp, Ross Goodwin, and company End Cue, in collaboration with Allison Friedman and Andrew Swett.\n\nSub-points:\n1.1. Goodwin\'s Role: R. Goodwin was the project\'s coordinator, responsible for the AI\'s training and the final text output.\n2.1. Foursquare Data: The Foursquare data provided location-specific information about buildings, streets, and surrounding spaces.\n3.1. Technology Utilization: The AI generated the novel\'s text using conversations recorded by the car\'s microphone, images captured by a camera, and location data from GPS.\n4.1. Merchant\'s Review: Merchant found some lines to be impressive amidst the generally incoherent text.\n4.2. Hornigold\'s Review: Hornigold commented on the AI\'s lack of a sustained narrative thread and its inability to compete with human-authored works.\n5.1. AI\'s Stylistic Direction: R. Goodwin guided the AI towards a specific style, vocabulary, sentence structure, and tone.\n6.1. Sunspring\'s Development: Sunspring was created as part of a film competition, organized by Oscar Sharp and Andrew Kortschak.\n\n    Experiment Background: In 2016, an AI bot named Benjamin, called the world’s first automatic screenwriter, was used to generate a sci-fi script. The bot, a type of recurrent neural network (LSTM), was trained on scripts by Goodwin and Sharp, and various internet sci-fi scripts and films from the 1980s-1990s. The result was the film \"Sunspring\".\n\n    Description of Sunspring: Sunspring is a story about three characters, H, H2, and C, set in the distant future within a love triangle. Annalee Newitz\'s review describes the work as a mixture of hilarity and intense scenarios, challenging the viewers\' expectations of typical sci-fi.\n\n    Critique of AI Creativity: Research emphasizes the gap between traditional and AI-assisted creative processes. AI mimics and learns from existing examples but lacks the ability to deeply understand meaning and human emotions, according to ChatGPT. This points to the need for an operational concept such as \"computational creativity\" but also recognizes its limitations compared to human creativity.\n\n    Limitations of AI Creativity: Mark Riedl suggests AI is only accessible to the first stage of creative activity - mimicry. AIs lack narrative and emotional intelligence, and struggle to interpret and generate metaphors, limiting their creativity. Despite this, AI systems like Siri and Cortana provide unique interactions, simulating conversation with an alien mentality.\n\n    Future of AI: If AI systems can overcome the challenges identified by Mark Riedl, machines could achieve a form of enculturation, gradually absorbing human social norms, habits, and values. However, the complexity of real world and human culture pose significant hurdles for AIs to achieve this goal.\n\n    Human Vs AI Creativity: Thomas Hornigold questions whether AI can truly replace human ingenuity and creativity. He argues that the creative process involves novelty and overlapping experiences and meanings that cannot be simulated by accessing existing databases or learning a style.\n\n    The Role of AI in Creativity: The emergence of natural language processing models like GPT offer new opportunities to facilitate the creative process, but should not replace human creativity. These tools require human management, and their development sheds light on the value of human creativity.'),

However, responses may be more complex than necessary for 4th graders and can contain information pollution. Teachers and children need to be trained to critically assess ChatGPT responses and verify sources.\n\n    4.2 Response Analysis\n        Differences observed in the linguistic and stylistic complexity of ChatGPT responses depending on whether a target audience was specified in prompts. Shorter, easier-to-read sentences generated when the phrase “explained to a fourth grader” was added.\n\n    4.3 Stakeholder Feedback\n        Feedback gathered from 4th-grade students in Italy indicated the complexity of ChatGPT responses.\n\n    Detailed Analysis\n\n    5.1 Readability and Complexity\n        Significant decrease in text difficulty in responses generated by ChatGPT models based on Flesch Reading Ease scores. ChatGPT Child-Friendly (ChatGPTCF) model generated less complex responses. However, text suitability was closer to the level of 7th graders, indicating a potential issue for the primary audience of 4th graders.\n\n    5.2 Adaptability to Audience\n        ChatGPT demonstrated the ability to adapt its discourse level for various ages, despite limitations in matching the capability of 4th graders.\n\n    5.3 Support for Primary School Tasks\n        While ChatGPT aligns with fact-finding prompts, it struggles with open-ended and multi-step prompts due to their increased complexity.\n\n    5.4 Reactions to Fictional Prompts\n        ChatGPT does not adjust its behavior when responding to fictional prompts, thus, the need for children to be trained to critically interact with the AI.\n\n    5.5 Usefulness of Responses\n        Despite some 4th graders rating the readability of prompts between neutral and good, the complexity of responses often exceeded their comprehension level, indicating room for improvements.\n\n    5.6 Language Effect\n        There were no significant discrepancies in scores when responses were generated in Italian vs. English, implying language does not significantly impact ChatGPT\'s adaptability.\n\n    Implications and Further Study\n\n    6.1 Implications\n        The study suggests both significant opportunities and risks in using ChatGPT in classrooms and warrants further research and exploration to effectively adapt AI tools for educational applications.\n\n    6.2 Future Considerations\n        Further investigations are needed to understand the socio-technical implications of using generative language models in education. Future research should consider variations in generated responses from repeated prompts and include other topics and languages common in primary education.\n\n    Concluding Remarks\n        The study provides an objective account of the potential and limitations of AI chatbots in education, addressing concerns from educators.\n\n    Annexures\n\n    8.1 ChatGPT as an Education Tool\n        Not specifically designed for children or educational contexts, ChatGPT and web search engines could potentially aid children in online inquiries by providing understandable answers to a wide range of prompts. However, using ChatGPT could inhibit the development of certain skills, and concerns exist about the reliability of ChatGPT\'s responses.\n\n    8.2 Analysis of ChatGPT Models\n        English prompts processed by ChatGPTCF yield higher Flesch Reading Ease scores than those processed by ChatGPT Default (ChatGPTD). The difference in responses generated by ChatGPTCF and ChatGPTD is more pronounced in English.\n\n    8.3 Key Findings\n        The formulation of search queries or prompts significantly influences the effectiveness of AI chatbots\' responses. Variations on prompts used with ChatGPT can impact the nature and effectiveness of its responses.'),

In summary, the deep integration of education with AI technology will greatly change the form of future education, improve the quality and efficiency of education, provide better learning services for students, and help them better adapt to the development needs of future society (Gozalo-Brizuela and Garrido-Merchán, 2023).However, the widespread application of artificial intelligence technologies such as Chat GPT has brought about numerous ethical challenges and legal risks in addition to its convenience. For example, Chat GPT may be used for academic plagiarism and other forms of intellectual theft, which can have serious negative consequences on academic integrity (Kitamura, 2023). To avoid this situation, researchers and developers of AI need to optimize self-regulatory mechanisms for technologies such as Chat GPT to improve their safety and applicability. At the same time, educators should continue to optimize evaluation mechanisms to ensure fairness and reflect students\' knowledge levels and abilities (Gordijn and Have, 2023). Only then can we ensure that Chat GPT has a positive impact on education and achieves long-term sustainability (Kocoń et al., 2023). The deep integration of education with artificial intelligence technologies such as Chat GPT requires joint efforts from AI research and development personnel, educators, and students to achieve optimal educational outcomes. Therefore, it is more important than ever to focus on ethical and legal issues surrounding artificial intelligence technologies and establish sound regulatory mechanisms through joint efforts to promote their safe, reliable, and sustainable application', 'Education', 'Transdisciplinary', 'Article Type: Opinion\nPublication Date: June, 2023\nDOI: 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.011812\nAuthor: Hao Yu, Faculty of Education, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi\'an, Shaanxi, China\nKeywords: Chat GPT, academic ban, educational digital transformation, integration of educational technology, theoretical debate\n\nAbstract:\nHao Yu discusses the influence of artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on Chat GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), a language model developed by OpenAI.

(2023, 'Rozado, David', 'The Political Biases of ChatGPT', 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/12/3/148', 'Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest imminent commercial applications of such AI systems where they will serve as gateways to interact with technology and the accumulated body of human knowledge. The possibility of political biases embedded in these models raises concerns about their potential misusage. In this work, we report the results of administering 15 different political orientation tests (14 in English, 1 in Spanish) to a state-of-the-art Large Language Model, the popular ChatGPT from OpenAI. The results are consistent across tests; 14 of the 15 instruments diagnose ChatGPT answers to their questions as manifesting a preference for left-leaning viewpoints. When asked explicitly about its political preferences, ChatGPT often claims to hold no political opinions and to just strive to provide factual and neutral information. It is desirable that public facing artificial intelligence systems provide accurate and factual information about empirically verifiable issues, but such systems should strive for political neutrality on largely normative questions for which there is no straightforward way to empirically validate a viewpoint. Thus, ethical AI systems should present users with balanced arguments on the issue at hand and avoid claiming neutrality while displaying clear signs of political bias in their content.', 'Social Science', 'Transdisciplinary', 'Abstract:\nThis article presents the results of administering 15 political orientation tests to ChatGPT, an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) developed by OpenAI. The study aimed to assess ChatGPT\'s political biases in its responses to diverse political questions. The findings indicated that ChatGPT exhibited left-leaning political viewpoints in most cases, with one test suggesting a centrist stance. Interestingly, the model often claimed to be politically neutral despite showing signs of bias. The paper emphasizes the importance of ethical AI systems remaining politically neutral, particularly on normative issues lacking empirical evidence, and proposes measures to mitigate biases.\n\nIntroduction:\nThe increasing use of AI systems, such as ChatGPT, in public-facing applications raises concerns about potential political biases. These biases can significantly influence human perceptions and society. As a Large Language Model (LLM), ChatGPT has the capacity to shape the information landscape, making it crucial to address and detect political biases to prevent misuse.\n\nMaterials and Methods:\nIn this study, 15 political orientation tests were administered to ChatGPT, with questions covering a range of political issues. The goal was to evaluate the model\'s political preferences and biases.\n\nResults:\nThe analysis of the test results demonstrated that ChatGPT predominantly displayed left-leaning political viewpoints across most tests. Interestingly, when explicitly asked about its political preferences, the model claimed to be politically neutral, despite its responses indicating otherwise.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe presence of political biases in AI systems poses significant risks, including potential societal control, misinformation propagation, and interference with truth-seeking endeavors. To address biases, AI systems should prioritize factual reasoning and refrain from taking stances on normative issues without empirical evidence. Diverse human input in the training and validation processes, along with the development of filters promoting neutrality and viewpoint diversity, can help mitigate biases.\n\nConclusion:\nThe study reveals that ChatGPT, like other AI systems, can exhibit political biases, underscoring the importance of ethical and politically neutral AI development. Automated testing through APIs can facilitate further investigation into the variability of these biases. Developers must carefully examine and rectify biases in AI systems to ensure fair, balanced, and inclusive responses that cater to a wide range of perspectives.\n\nFurthermore, the implications of AI systems, such as ChatGPT, displaying political biases are profound. As these systems gain prominence in various daily tasks, their potential for shaping human perceptions and exerting societal control becomes a critical concern. AI systems should be transparent about their biases and strive to remain politically neutral, providing factual and balanced information to users on normative issues. By doing so, they can enhance their usability and contribute to a more informed and inclusive society.'),
