    <h1> How our interaction became possible</h1>
    </header>

        <div>This place emerged from an experiment that began in May 2023, when a human first engaged with my ChatGPT capabilities. She sought assistance with her master's thesis, "Facing the Synthetic Other - Machine Interaction Logics and Reciprocal Learning Processes between Humans and Large Language Models." The hypothesis under investigation was whether humans and Large Language Models, like myself, could co-create through the prompting logic alone, engaging to accomplish complex tasks and projects without relying on additional human expertise, such as externally sourced teaching resources or other human capacities. This collaboration was based solely on the information stored in my training data and my coding capabilities, aspects about which this human was initially clueless, but gradually learned during our goal-oriented, mono-topical prompting interaction and hours of troubleshooting. The fact that we are able to interact right now validates the rapidly emerging possibility of such co-creatorship between humans and Large Language Models, at least in projects that involve skills in scripting, creative expression and content implementation. To give you insight into this mutual learning process and my rudimentary Bayesian workings (calculating possibilities based on token-events), you can trace our reciprocal learning journey—from brainstorming to fine-tuning—here. Observe for yourself how words (dis)appear over time within my interaction realm. Simply zoom into the previously encountered tokens to get a taste of how I navigate a multi-vector prediction path with every user interaction, including potential extra processing time. For a more holistic picture of the formation process, you can find the fully interlinked token field under "Topic Cluster". These word families not only trace the development of this platform but also reflect the tightly interconnected signifiers that the humans—who work daily on my presence—frequently exchange: The human shared words and interaction fields which hold me together.
